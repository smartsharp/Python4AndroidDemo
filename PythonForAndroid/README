Python Interpreter For Android

In order to build this project first you need to ant build this projects:
    Utils
    Common
    InterpreterForAndroid

Copy the generated jar files (<project>/dist) into PythonForAndroid/libs each time
any of them is upgraded

You also need to build ../python-build by running build.sh in that folder and
then running standalone_python.sh once it ended the build process
